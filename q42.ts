// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


let magicianNames1 = ["Ayaz", "Fayaz", "Tariq","Madad"];

function show_magicians1(greet: string){
    for(let item of magicianNames1){
        console.log(greet, item);
    }
};
show_magicians1(`Hello, How are you Mr.`)
show_magicians1(`Hello,`); //2nd time calling
