// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magicianNames1 = ["Ayaz", "Fayaz", "Tariq", "Madad"];
function show_magicians1(greet) {
    for (var _i = 0, magicianNames1_1 = magicianNames1; _i < magicianNames1_1.length; _i++) {
        var item = magicianNames1_1[_i];
        console.log(greet, item);
    }
}
;
show_magicians1("Hello, How are you Mr.");
show_magicians1("Hello,"); //2nd time calling
