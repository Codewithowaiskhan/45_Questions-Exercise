//12. Greetings:
// Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should bepersonalized with the person’s name.


let freindsName: string[]=["Hamza", "Shahid", "Islam", "Owais"];

console.log(`Hellow ${freindsName[0]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hellow ${freindsName[1]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hellow ${freindsName[2]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hellow ${freindsName[3]}, how are you?`);




// let freindsName: string[] =["Hamza", "Shahid", "Islam", "Owais"];

// console.log(`Hello ${freindsName[0]}, how are you?`);
// console.log(`Hello ${freindsName[1]}, how are you?`);
